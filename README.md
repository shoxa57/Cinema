# 🎬 Movie Nexus | Neural Cinema Interface

**Movie Nexus** is a high-end, futuristic movie discovery platform inspired by cyberpunk aesthetics. Built with vanilla technologies, it leverages the TMDB API to provide a seamless "Neural" experience for browsing and watching cinematic content.

![Movie Nexus Preview](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x600?text=Movie+Nexus+Cyberpunk+Interface) ## 🚀 Key Features

- **Neural UI Design:** Featuring a sophisticated Glassmorphism effect, 24px-30px border radiuses, and high-fidelity neon accents.
- **Dynamic Backgrounds:** The entire interface reacts to your movements. Hovering over a movie card smoothly transitions the site's background to that movie's specific backdrop.
- **Integrated Cinema Player:** Watch movies directly within the app via a custom-styled modal window with built-in metadata (ratings, release dates, and overviews).
- **Advanced Neural Search:** A sleek, animated search bar with visual feedback, glowing focus states, and real-time database scanning.
- **Responsive Layout:** Optimized for all sectors—from mobile handhelds to ultra-wide desktop monitors.

## 🛠 Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Variables, CSS Grid, Flexbox).
- **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) using the Fetch API for asynchronous data streams.
- **API:** Powered by [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
- **Design:** Glassmorphism, backdrop-blur filters, and custom CSS animations.

## 📂 Project Structure

* `index.html` - The structural core of the neural interface.
* `style.css` - Cyberpunk styling, neon variables, and layout logic.
* `script.js` - API communication, modal logic, and dynamic background handling.

## 🚀 Getting Started


1. **Configure API Key:**
Open `script.js` and insert your TMDB V3 API Key:
```javascript
const TMDB_KEY = 'your_api_key_here';

```


2. **Launch:**
Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The project follows a "Neural-Glass" philosophy:

* **Depth:** Using `backdrop-filter: blur(15px)` to create layers of information.
* **Vibrancy:** Accents in `#58a6ff` (Neural Blue) to guide the user's eye.
* **Fluidity:** 0.4s cubic-bezier transitions for a premium, non-linear feel.
